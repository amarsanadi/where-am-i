# ros-ball-chasing-bot
First steps on the ROS platform and second project in the Udacity Robotics Software Nanodegree Program. 
A Gazebo world and a Robot placed within it that chases white balls.
The robot spins on the spot at a fixed rate until it detects a white ball within its field of view. 
It then moves towards the ball.
